This is the userscripts folder.
These execute everytime a page is visited.

Normal template for a userscript:

|___script
|___|___allowedurls.txt
|___|___script.js

The script.js file is the actual script.
The allowedurls.txt file is a list of allowed urls (in regex) for this script.

Also, be careful because some userscripts might steal your data!
